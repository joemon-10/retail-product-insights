# Product Segmentation and Market Basket Analysis

While exploring customer segmentation with the UCI Online Retail dataset, I came across a research paper that applied RFM analysis to cluster customers. That sparked a question:

> ðŸ’¡ "If we can segment customers to improve targeting, why not segment the **products** themselves to improve profit?"

This project flips the lens â€” instead of analyzing who is buying, weâ€™re analyzing **what is being bought**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

- Segment products based on their sales behavior (price, quantity, volume)
- Discover co-purchased product combinations using association rule mining

These insights can help businesses â€” especially those serving wholesale buyers â€” improve bundling, cross-selling, and inventory planning.
